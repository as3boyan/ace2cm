# Ace to CodeMirror Converter

*Convert your Ace syntax highlighter to CodeMirror!*

Ace has a number of syntax sheets to provide support for those languages in
their editor. CodeMirror does as well. However, Ace has some sheets that
CodeMirror does not (and inversely).

This software translates Ace syntax sheets to CodeMirror's format.
